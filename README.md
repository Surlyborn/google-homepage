This is a project that is dedicated to learning the foundational knowledge needed to becoming a web-dev.
This first part of this mini-project is to alter an already existing website. There will be challenges and knowledge to be learned. I will continue to update this file along the way to see what else I need to learn.
I haven't fully grasped what is needed in a README.md if there is nothing to explain about an install process. Or showing a future employer your rationale behind something. Maybe that's it.
